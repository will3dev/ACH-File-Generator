This project was a first attempt at utilizing Tkinter.

With this application a user is able to create ACH files. The file created will only contain one batch but 
can contain multiple receivers in each batch. Users will be able to creat, edit, and delete both originators and receivers.
Receivers are tied to originators and if an originator is deleted the receiver info is unaccessible as well.
